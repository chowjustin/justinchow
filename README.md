## My Personal Landing Page

Welcome to my personal landing page, a dynamic project that marks my first foray into web development. This site is a testament to my journey of continuous learning and experimentation, built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

- Developed using `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, and `Tailwind CSS` for a sleek and efficient user experience.
- UI/UX meticulously crafted in `Figma`, ensuring intuitive navigation and aesthetic appeal.
- Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), guaranteeing reliability and lightning-fast loading times.
- Designed to be adaptive across all devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience regardless of screen size.
